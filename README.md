     - Customers who havenâ€™t booked yet
     - Top customers by bookings
     - Most popular packages
     - Monthly booking and revenue trends
     - Average ratings per package

*ðŸ”¹ Technical Stack & SQL Features Used

- Database: MySQL (Relational Database).
- Schema Design: Tables with Primary Keys, Foreign Keys, Unique constraints, and relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-Many via PackageGuides).
- Data Types: INT AUTO_INCREMENT, VARCHAR, TEXT, DECIMAL, DATE, DATETIME, BOOLEAN.
- DDL: CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, constraints (DEFAULT, FOREIGN KEY).
- DML: INSERT INTO with sample realistic data (customers, destinations, packages, bookings, payments, etc.).
- DQL: SELECT, JOIN, LEFT JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT.
- Functions: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MONTH(), CURDATE().

## ER Diagram

The ER diagram of the database is included and highlights relationships such as:
- One-to-Many between Customers and Bookings
- One-to-Many between Destinations and TourPackages
- Many-to-Many between Guides and TourPackages (via PackageGuides)
- One-to-Many between TourPackages and Activities
- One-to-Many between Bookings and Payments
- One-to-Many between TourPackages and Reviews

## Usage

1. Run `creating website database.sql` to create the schema.
2. Run `inserting values.sql` to populate with sample data.
3. Run `retieving values.sql` to execute predefined queries and generate insights.

## Purpose

This database simulates a travel booking platform where users can:
- Browse destinations and packages
- Make bookings with discounts
- Write reviews
- Make payments
- Get guided tours and activities

Admins can monitor operations, analyze trends, and manage platform activities.
